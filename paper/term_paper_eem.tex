\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The Covid-19 epidemic forced sports leagues in Germany to suspend
championships that were already in full swing. For example, the
Kreisliga Herren Klasse 2 in Recklinghausen finished around 150 games,
before the rest were canceled starting from Sunday 2020-03-12, leaving
around 90 games left unplayed until the last planned day of the
tournament on Sunday 2020-05-24. Given the distinct possibility that
there won't be a chance to make up those games later, a burning question
for many players and fans is naturally: What if they would have played
those games? We attempt to use data on games already played from the
website
\href{http://www.fussball.de/spielplan/re-kl-a-2-kreis-recklinghausen-kreisliga-a-herren-saison1920-westfalen/-/staffel/027II28DS800000DVS5489B3VS3GHJJU-G\#!/section/matchplan}{fussball.de}
to answer this question, drawing on established forecasting methods from
the literature.

\hypertarget{literature}{%
\section{Literature}\label{literature}}

Some difficulties that have to be addressed in predicting outcomes of
e.g.~the FIFA World Cup, are not relevant to the Kreisliga. For example,
the league system in Germany features two rounds per season. Each club
plays each other club tiwce: Once in each round, and once on each club's
home field. This reduces the uncertainty, when compared with the mode of
the World Cup. There, in the group stage groups are determined by luck
of the draw, a process known as \enquote{seeding}. Groups then play a so
called round-robin tournament, also known as all-play-all, were every
every group member plays each other, which corresponds to the mode in
which the Kreisliga plays. The World Cup then continues with
single-elimination, or a knock-out stage, which introduces another even
more random path dependencies. This implies that the existing literature
on forecasting results in the FIFA World Cup group stage is highly
relevant for the task at hand, since the game rules are identical.

A natural starting point for forecasting match or season outcomes in
football tournaments is using the FIFA points ranking method that is
used canonically to evaluate the strength of a team and updated after
each game. For example, a recent study by Correa et
al.~\autocite*{correa} uses FIFA points to forecast the results of the
2018 FIFA Men's World Cup. This approach has however generated criticism
and other methods have been proposed and evaluated. The benchmark study
by Laseck et al.~\autocite*{lasek2013} compares established and proposed
rankings. They find that FIFA rankings used to perform slightly worse
than alternative methods, especially two versions of the Elo rating
system originally proposed by Arpad Elo for the United States Chess
Federation to rate competitive chess players. We will consider using the
FIFA points method or these two alternative candidates.

The first candidate model is published by the anonymous website
EloRatings.net \autocite*{eloratings}, and is especially adapted for the
use in ranking football teams. The second one is the FIFA Women's World
Rankings, which has been in use since 2003. It is worth noting that the
FIFA Men's World Rankings have been adapted in 2018 to also be based on
a modification of the Elo ranking.

The website FuPa.net \autocite*{fupa} also publishes detailed statistics
as well as a so called \enquote{Power-Ranking} to evaluate the
\enquote{Formkurve}, a rough measure of recent performance. Because it
is only reflective of very recent games, it is not useful for long term
forecasting. Another raw measure would be to calculate the probability
of winning by dividing team's current points (victories are 3, draws are
2) by the total of their and their opponent's points, we can call this
the \enquote{points model}.

All these models just use weighted game results or point scores. Another
approach would be to use more data, as in Berbée et
al.~\autocite*{baseball}. While this concerns baseball, the principle is
not dependent on the rules of the game, but it is based on the influence
of individuals' and team's statistics on game outcomes. This is an
application of the model proposed by Albert and Bennet
\autocite*{bennet2007}. They use the fact that wins and losses appear to
be normally distributed in the long run, so chance and skill should both
play a role. Team ability is then calculated as the deviation from the
average winning probability over time. Very generally, available
statistics are then evaluated to find those that matter the most for
team performance, measured in runs per game, which would be goals in
football. Those candidate factors are then weighted by regressing them
on the team performance. The resulting index is then used to calculate a
winning probability and this used then to simulate the season outcome by
using weighted coin-flips.

While there is not as much individual player data in football on the
level of our analysis, the team average is still something that can be
calculated. Also, more information on the games, such as location at
home or away, could be candidate factors for performance. For example,
one team might benefit more from playing at home than it hurts by being
away, receiving a net benefit from location, or the other way around.
While these data are certainly interesting, we must be aware of the
danger of overfitting the model.

Finally the literature contains references to using betting markets as a
benchmark, as they perform relatively well as predictors. For the
Kreisliga however, we don't expect betting markets to be deep enough to
reach this level of accuracy. Otherwise, they would also be an
interesting reference point.

\section{Predictive Model}\label{predictive-model}}

To predict the outcome of the cancelled games, we calculate the
candidate rankings and use them to simulate the end of the 2019/2020
season. Specifically we calculate the EloRankings.net Ranking, the FIFA
Women's Ranking, the points model and a version of the Total Team
Average incorporating additional information. We discard the classic
FIFA Men's Ranking, since it was shown to perform worse than the other
candidates and was discarded by the FIFA Men's World Rankings as well in
2018.

Following Correa et al.~\autocite*{correa}, we then run the simulation
by drawing the results of each game from a binomial distribution. For
each game and team, the probability of winning is dividing the ranking
points awarded each team by their and their competitors sum of points.

Running this simulation repeatedly should indicate the distribution and
expected average of outcomes. Correa et al.~\autocite*{correa} execute
200,000 runs, but because of the relatively low complexity of the
Kreisliga's format compared to the World Cup, especially because there
are no eleminiation rounds, we expect to need less repetitions.
